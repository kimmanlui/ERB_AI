The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms (kg) by their height in metres (m) squared.
If you weigh 70kg and are 1.73m tall, you work out your BMI by: squaring your height: 1.73x1.73 = 2.99. dividing 70 by 2.99 = 23.41.


```{r}

my.height <- readline(prompt="Enter height: ")
my.weight <- readline(prompt="Enter weight: ")
# convert character into integer
my.height <- as.numeric(my.height)
my.weight <- as.numeric(my.weight)
bmi=my.weight / (my.height*my.height)
print(paste("Hi,  your bmi is", bmi))
```

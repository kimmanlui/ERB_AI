Task 1: load the required package
```{r}
library(package=   )
```


Task 2: load the yahoo data 
```{r}


trainData = read.csv(             , header=TRUE)

print(trainData)
```

task 3: Create an additional column to determine whether the closing value for today has increased or decreased compared to the Opening value for today.
```{r}


trainData$updown = ifelse(        ) 
print(trainData)
```



Task 4: Complete the model 
```{r}
model=neuralnet(formula       =                       ,
                data          =  trainData            , 
                hidden        =                       ,
                stepmax       =  1e+05                , 
                act.fct       = "logistic"            ,
                linear.output = FALSE                 )
```




Task 5: Predict today's HSI
```{r}
predictData=neuralnet::compute(model, data.frame(Open=    , High=   , Low=   ))
print(predictData)
```
